## Customization Guide

### Adapting Examples to Your Data

#### 1. Replace Sample Data
```python
# Instead of:
portfolio = create_sample_portfolio(num_skus=10)

# Use your data:
portfolio = pd.read_csv('your_inventory_data.csv')
```

#### 2. Adjust Cost Parameters
```python
# Customize for your business:
eoq = EOQMethod(
    holding_cost=YOUR_HOLDING_COST,      # Your warehouse costs
    ordering_cost=YOUR_ORDERING_COST,    # Your procurement costs
    unit_cost=YOUR_UNIT_COST            # Your product costs
)
```

#### 3. Configure Service Levels
```python
# Set your target service level:
safety_stock = SafetyStockMethod(
    service_level=0.99,  # 99% for critical items
    # or 0.95 for standard items
    # or 0.90 for low-priority items
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd JAX_Inventory_Optimizer

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python -c "import jax; print(jax.__version__)"
```

### API Connection Errors
```bash
# Make sure API server is running
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# Check server health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check JAX device
python -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"

# For GPU acceleration, install CUDA-enabled JAX
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

Portfolio Overview:
  Number of SKUs: 100
  Total inventory value: $156,234.50
  Average inventory: 124.3 units

Optimization Results:
  Current daily holding cost: $856.21
  Optimal daily holding cost: $623.45
  Daily savings: $232.76
  Annual savings: $84,957.40

âš¡ Performance Note: JAX JIT compilation provides 50-100x speedup
```

### ML Forecasting Output
```
Example 3: ML vs Traditional Methods
================================================================================

Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
  Traditional (EOQ): 8.23
  LSTM:              5.47
  Improvement:       33.5%

Why LSTM Performs Better:
  - Captures temporal patterns and trends
  - Learns from sequence relationships
  - Adapts to seasonality
  - Better for complex, non-stationary demand
